### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. candidate at KoÃ§ University, [KUIS AI Center](https://ai.ku.edu.tr), under the supervision of [Deniz Yuret](https://www.denizyuret.com). My main research area is natural language processing. In particular, I'm currently working on language grounding to vision through commonsense knowledge and reasoning. The easiest way to contact me is to [send an email](mailto:ikesen16_at_ku.edu.tr). Here are some helpful links about me,
