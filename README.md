### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoc at [Language and Multimodal Processing Group](https://lampgroup.github.io/) at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen. Previously, I was a PhD student at KoÃ§ University, under the supervision of [Deniz Yuret](https://www.denizyuret.com) and [Aykut Erdem](https://aykuterdem.github.io/). My main research area is natural language processing (NLP). In particular, I'm currently working on multimodal and/or multilingual language learning. The easiest way to contact me is to [send an email](mailto:ilkerksn@gmail.com). Here are some helpful links about me,
