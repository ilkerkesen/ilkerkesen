### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a research scientist at KoÃ§ University, [KUIS AI Center](https://ai.ku.edu.tr). Previously, I was a PhD student at KoÃ§ University, under the supervision of [Deniz Yuret](https://www.denizyuret.com) and [Aykut Erdem](https://aykuterdem.github.io/). My main research area is natural language processing (NLP). In particular, I'm currently working on language-vision problems and Turkish NLP. The easiest way to contact me is to [send an email](mailto:ikesen16_at_ku.edu.tr). Here are some helpful links about me,
